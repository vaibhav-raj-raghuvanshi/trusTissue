# 🛡️ trusTissue – Bridging Trust Between Buyers and Sellers
trusTissue is a trust-layer platform that acts as a verification bridge between buyers and sellers across platforms like Telegram, Instagram, and other informal marketplaces. It ensures that the product a seller is offering matches exactly what the buyer expects—before the deal goes through.

# 🔍 Key Features
- 🧾 Seller Listing System: Sellers can list their digital or physical products with claimed specs.
- 📥 Buyer Request Portal: Buyers can submit verification requests with links and expectations.
- 📁 Secure File Uploads: Sellers or verifiers can upload product files, screenshots, or media.
- ✅ Manual & Semi-Automated Verification: Check if a product actually matches its claimed specs.
- 🧑‍⚖️ Verifier Dashboard: Admins or trusted users can compare and verify submitted specs.
- 📄 Transparency Reports: Buyers get verified status updates with evidence, before making a purchase.

# 🧠 Why trusTissue?
Too many transactions on unregulated platforms suffer from fraud, misrepresentation, and uncertainty. trusTissue solves this problem by introducing a neutral verification layer — making digital commerce safer, especially on platforms that don’t offer built-in buyer protection.
